## 📊 Script 1: Comparative Analysis (`comparative_analysis.py`)

### Purpose
Performs comprehensive cross-model comparison to identify best performing models, detect shortcut learning, and assess model transferability across datasets.

### Theory & Plots

#### 1. **ROC-AUC Performance Heatmap**
**Theory**: ROC-AUC measures a model's ability to distinguish between benign and attack samples across all threshold values. Values closer to 1.0 indicate better discrimination ability.

**Analogy**: Think of this like a security guard's ability to spot suspicious people. A perfect guard (AUC = 1.0) would always correctly identify threats without false alarms. A random guard (AUC = 0.5) would be no better than flipping a coin.

**What to Look For**:
- 🟢 **Green cells (>0.8)**: Excellent model performance
- 🟡 **Yellow cells (0.6-0.8)**: Moderate performance  
- 🔴 **Red cells (<0.6)**: Poor performance, close to random

#### 2. **PR-AUC Performance Heatmap**
**Theory**: PR-AUC focuses on performance when positive samples (attacks) are rare. Unlike ROC-AUC, it's more sensitive to class imbalance and prioritizes correctly identifying the minority class.

**Analogy**: Imagine searching for a specific type of rare flower in a vast forest. PR-AUC measures how good you are at finding these rare flowers without wasting time on false leads. Even if you're great at avoiding non-flowers (specificity), if you miss the actual flowers you're looking for, your PR-AUC will be low.

**What to Look For**:
- **Low PR-AUC values (0.01-0.1)** are normal for highly imbalanced cybersecurity datasets
- **Relative differences** matter more than absolute values
- Models with higher PR-AUC are better at catching attacks without too many false alarms

#### 3. **Performance Distribution by Model**
**Theory**: Box plots show the distribution of performance scores across datasets, revealing model consistency and outliers.

**Analogy**: Think of three different teachers grading the same set of exams. A teacher with a tight box plot gives consistent grades, while one with a wide box plot has more variability. The median line shows their average grading level.

**Components**:
- **Box**: 25th to 75th percentile (middle 50% of scores)
- **Median line**: Middle value
- **Whiskers**: Range of typical scores
- **Outliers**: Unusual performance on specific datasets

#### 4. **Dataset Difficulty Assessment**
**Theory**: Calculated as `1 - mean_ROC_AUC` across all models. Higher difficulty scores indicate datasets that challenge most models.

**Analogy**: Like rating the difficulty of video game levels based on how many players struggle with them. If even expert players (top models) have trouble, the level (dataset) is genuinely difficult.

**Difficulty Levels**:
- 🟢 **EASY (< 0.25)**: Most models perform well
- 🟡 **MEDIUM (0.25-0.4)**: Moderate challenge
- 🔴 **HARD (> 0.4)**: Challenges even the best models

### 🔍 Shortcut Learning Detection

#### 5. **Feature Set Impact Analysis**
**Theory**: Compares performance on basic features (v1) vs extended features (v2). Large performance drops suggest the model was relying on shortcuts rather than learning genuine attack patterns.

**Analogy**: Imagine a student who memorizes specific exam questions vs one who understands the underlying concepts. When you change the questions (extended features), the memorizer's performance drops dramatically, while the conceptual learner maintains performance.

**Shortcut Learning Risk Levels**:
- 🟢 **LOW (< 2% drop)**: Model learned robust patterns
- 🟡 **MEDIUM (2-5% drop)**: Some shortcut dependency
- 🔴 **HIGH (> 5% drop)**: Heavy reliance on shortcuts

#### 6. **Model Consistency Analysis**
**Theory**: Uses coefficient of variation (CV = std/mean) to measure how consistently a model performs across different datasets.

**Analogy**: Like measuring how consistent a basketball player's shooting is across different courts. A consistent player performs similarly regardless of the venue, while an inconsistent player's performance varies wildly.

**Consistency Score = 1 - CV**:
- **Higher scores (>0.9)**: Very consistent model
- **Lower scores (<0.8)**: Performance varies significantly across datasets

## 🎯 Script 2: Dataset Quality Analyzer (`dataset_quality_analyzer.py`)

### Purpose
Performs advanced analysis of dataset quality using latent space projections and reconstruction error patterns to identify potential data quality issues.

### Theory & Advanced Metrics

#### 1. **Feature Space Separability Analysis**
**Theory**: Analyzes how well benign and attack samples are separated in the learned feature space using multiple geometric and statistical measures.

**Analogy**: Imagine you're organizing a library by placing similar books near each other. Good separability means fiction and non-fiction books naturally cluster in different areas. Poor separability means they're randomly mixed throughout.

**Key Metrics**:

##### **Centroid Distance**
- **Theory**: Euclidean distance between average positions of benign and attack clusters
- **Analogy**: Distance between the "center of mass" of two different types of objects
- **Higher values**: Better natural separation

##### **Silhouette Score**
- **Theory**: Measures how similar samples are to their own cluster vs other clusters (-1 to +1)
- **Analogy**: How "at home" each person feels in their assigned neighborhood
- **Positive values**: Good clustering, **Negative values**: Poor clustering

##### **Calinski-Harabasz Index**
- **Theory**: Ratio of between-cluster variance to within-cluster variance
- **Analogy**: Comparing how different the neighborhoods are vs how similar houses within each neighborhood are
- **Higher values**: Better defined clusters

#### 2. **Reconstruction Error Analysis**
**Theory**: Analyzes the distribution overlap of reconstruction errors between benign and attack samples. Good datasets show clear separation in error distributions.

**Analogy**: Imagine a quality control inspector checking products. Good quality (benign) items should have small errors, while defective (attack) items should have large errors. If the error ranges overlap heavily, it's hard to distinguish quality levels.

**Overlap Metrics**:
- **Bhattacharyya Distance**: Measures distribution similarity (higher = better separation)
- **Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test**: Statistical test for distribution differences
- **Hellinger Distance**: Another distribution similarity measure

#### 3. **Combined Quality Score**
**Theory**: Weighted combination of separability and reconstruction error metrics, normalized to 0-1 scale.

**Formula**: `Quality = 0.4×Separability + 0.3×ReconstructionSeparation + 0.3×StatisticalSignificance`

**Quality Levels**:
- 🟢 **HIGH (> 0.7)**: Excellent dataset for model evaluation
- 🟡 **MEDIUM (0.4-0.7)**: Adequate but may have some issues
- 🔴 **LOW (< 0.4)**: Potential data quality problems

## 📈 Script 3: ROC Comparison Generator (`roc_comparison_generator.py`)

### Purpose
Creates publication-ready ROC and Precision-Recall curve comparisons with comprehensive statistical analysis.

### Theory & Visualization Types

#### 1. **ROC Curves (Receiver Operating Characteristic)**
**Theory**: Plots True Positive Rate (sensitivity) vs False Positive Rate (1-specificity) across all decision thresholds.

**Analogy**: Like tuning a smoke detector's sensitivity. More sensitive settings catch all fires (high TPR) but also trigger false alarms (high FPR). The ROC curve shows all possible sensitivity/false-alarm trade-offs.

**Curve Interpretation**:
- **Top-left corner**: Perfect classifier (100% sensitivity, 0% false alarms)
- **Diagonal line**: Random guessing
- **Area Under Curve (AUC)**: Overall discrimination ability

#### 2. **Precision-Recall Curves**
**Theory**: Plots Precision (positive predictive value) vs Recall (sensitivity), emphasizing performance on the minority class.

**Analogy**: Like a medical test for a rare disease. Precision asks "Of all positive test results, how many were actually sick?" Recall asks "Of all sick people, how many did we catch?" High precision means few false alarms; high recall means few missed cases.

**Why Important for Cybersecurity**:
- Attacks are rare (imbalanced data)
- Missing an attack (low recall) is costly
- False alarms (low precision) waste resources
- PR curves better reflect real-world performance trade-offs

#### 3. **Performance Distribution Analysis**
**Theory**: Box plots comparing ROC-AUC and PR-AUC distributions across models to identify consistent performers.

**Statistical Elements**:
- **Median**: Middle performance value
- **IQR (Interquartile Range)**: Spread of middle 50% of scores
- **Outliers**: Unusual performance values
- **Whiskers**: Full range of typical performance

#### 4. **Statistical Significance Testing**
**Theory**: Uses paired t-tests or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests to determine if performance differences between models are statistically meaningful.

**Analogy**: Like determining if one teacher's students consistently score higher than another's, accounting for natural variation in test scores.

### Lightweight Metrics

#### 1. **Model Performance Comparison**
**Theory**: Basic statistical comparison of ROC-AUC scores across models with confidence intervals.

**Analogy**: Like getting a quick health check-up vs a comprehensive physical exam. Covers the basics efficiently.

#### 2. **Model Consistency Score**
**Theory**: `Consistency = 1 - (std/mean)` measures performance stability across datasets.

**Interpretation**:
- **High consistency (>0.9)**: Reliable model across different scenarios
- **Low consistency (<0.7)**: Performance depends heavily on dataset characteristics

#### 3. **Dataset Difficulty Ranking**
**Theory**: Ranks datasets by average model performance, identifying which datasets challenge models most.

**Practical Use**: Helps prioritize which datasets to use for rigorous model evaluation.

#### 4. **Performance vs Difficulty Scatter Plot**
**Theory**: 2D visualization showing how each model performs relative to dataset difficulty.

**Analogy**: Like plotting student test scores vs exam difficulty. Good students maintain high scores even on hard exams; struggling students show steep performance drops.
